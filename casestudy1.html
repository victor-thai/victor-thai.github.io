                    <h2>CPI Time Series Prediction Modeling</h2>
                    <p class="intropara">
                        Growing up in America, I always wondered why the cost of items would continually grow and
                        decline in price.
                        Sometimes, fruits would be selling for under a dollar a pound, other times they were seen to be
                        sold at up to $5 per pound.
                        This drastic change in prices left me to dive deeper and analyze factors that caused this to
                        occur.
                        Initially, I thought this purely based on seasonality of items so I wanted to continue to dive
                        into any patterns.
                        Through a deeper analysis, I discovered that it was due to chain reactions from any field that
                        may be connected to the resources to
                        craft a respective product.
                        For example, an ongoing computer chip shortage has caused a dramatic increase in valuation for
                        cars since there
                        was a depleting resource supply to create these vehicles.
                        When all items get increasingly more expensive, this leaves the stock market to also follow
                        trends and increase in value as well since more people put money into the market as they
                        purchase items.
                        <b>The goal of this project is to determine any specific trends among CPI behavior to create a
                            prediction model that would pose as a reliable source to further forecast future CPI
                            behavior.</b>
                        This project may seem irrelevant to many individuals, but rather it is connected for all people
                        since CPI data can be a reflection of the economy of the country.
                        By understanding its behavior and being able to predict it accurately is a useful tool that all
                        people can use to determine whether they should continue investments among the market in the
                        short term scope.

                        For many consumers, they do not know that with changes in the consumer price index
                        there may be a ripple effect of changes onto other aspects of economic indicators
                        This can be in the form of interest rates, loan rates, and conversion rates for different
                        currencies which is often used in our everyday lives.
                        In this project, we aimed to solve the problem <b>"How can we accurately predict the behavior of
                            CPI [consumer price index] data from past data and
                            other extraneous PPI [Producer Price Index] data?" </b>b>

                    <p class="stepspara">
                        Among this project, I spearheaded the work as Project lead for this project. All members equally
                        contributed, however, what makes project lead stand out is that I was in charge of crafting the
                        timeline
                        and steps needed for this particular project.
                        Amongst all the work, ideas and implementation was done collectively with the team as a whole,
                        but
                        there were many occasions where I had to take a lead on learning new technologies and packages
                        that we used.
                        For our work, we researched the background behind each machine learning algorithm and team
                        decided what to do as
                        a group collective.
                    </p>
                    <p class="findingspara">
                        During data exploration, we noticed that all categories had a seasonal trend that would cause
                        dips
                        and increases based on a certain time period among a calendar year.
                        Most importantly, there were specific periods in our dataset where major dips were present,
                        caused from stops in the economy from extraneous factors. There were also other times where
                        times
                        throughout major holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas where spikes were seen from holiday
                        shopping.
                        In this project, our team used a variety of different time series modeling techniques including
                        VARIMA, SARIMA, Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression.

                        <br>
                        [include brief descriptions of each models performance]
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Accuracy of the VARIMA model proved to be the best among our predictions.
                        (explain why this was the best model)

                    </p>
                    <p class="reflectionpara">
                        Our initial analysis discovered that trends in consumer behavior played a major aspect in the
                        respective behavior of CPI and also the market as well. When looking into this at a deeper
                        level,
                        we noticed that other extraneous factors also played a part such as the significant dips for
                        COVID
                        and other times of recession where spending was reduced.
                        A further goal of our model is to allow users to be able to predict CPI index and therefore get
                        a better gauge as to when
                        a product is expensive as compared to when it is at a lower level.
                        This project was limited based on time and resources, but given that we had more time, our
                        intentions would be to create an interface that would tell users when the buy an item vs not buy
                        Furthermore, we hope to provide a time that would be better to buy certain items as compared to its value currently.
